## What is Codex?

Today we are launching a research preview of Codex: a cloud-based software engineering agent that can work on many tasks in parallel. Codex can perform tasks for you such as writing features, answering questions about your codebase, fixing bugs, and proposing pull requests for review; each task runs in its own cloud sandbox environment, preloaded with your repository.

## Codex is powered by codex-1

Codex is powered by codex-1, a version of OpenAI o3 optimized for software engineering. It was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world coding tasks in a variety of environments to generate code that closely mirrors human style and PR preferences, adheres precisely to instructions, and can iteratively run tests until it receives a passing result. We are starting to roll out Codex to ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team users today, with support for Plus and Edu coming soon.

## How to Use Codex

Today you can access Codex through the sidebar in ChatGPT and assign it new coding tasks by typing a prompt and clicking "Code". If you want to ask Codex a question about your codebase, click "Ask". Each task is processed independently in a separate, isolated environment preloaded with your codebase. Codex can read and edit files, as well as run commands including test harnesses, linters, and type checkers. Task completion typically takes between 1 and 30 minutes, depending on complexity, and you can monitor Codex's progress in real time.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Task Processing**: Work on multiple coding tasks simultaneously
- **Isolated Environments**: Each task runs in its own secure sandbox
- **Repository Integration**: Preloaded with your codebase for context-aware assistance
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track progress as Codex works on your tasks
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Access to test harnesses, linters, and type checkers

## Performance Benchmarks

*23 SWE-Bench Verified samples that were not runnable on our internal infrastructure were excluded. codex-1 was tested at a maximum context length of 192k tokens and medium 'reasoning effort', which is the setting that will be available in product today. For details on o3 evaluations, see here.*

## Availability

Codex is currently available to:
- **ChatGPT Pro users**: Available now
- **Enterprise users**: Available now  
- **Team users**: Available now
- **Plus users**: Coming soon
- **Edu users**: Coming soon
