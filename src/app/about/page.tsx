      <p>
        I craft impactful, user-centric products, focusing on seamless interactions and interface
        design. Passionate about collaboration, I thrive in multidisciplinary teams, always learning
        and innovating. Specializing in React, TypeScript, and modern web architectures, I build
        high-performance, scalable applications with real-time data and interactive UIs. Currently
        exploring motion design, GSAP, and Three.js to push digital experiences further.
