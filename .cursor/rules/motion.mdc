- [useScroll](mdc:docs/react-use-scroll.md): Learn how to create scroll-linked animations with Motion's simple yet powerful useScroll hook.
- [useSpring](mdc:docs/react-use-spring.md): useSpring creates a motion value that animates to its target with a spring.
- [useTime](mdc:docs/react-use-time.md): A motion value that updates every animation frame with the duration, in milliseconds, since it was created.
- [useTransform](mdc:docs/react-use-transform.md): useTransform creates a new motion value that transforms the output of one or more motion values.
- [useVelocity](mdc:docs/react-use-velocity.md): Create a motion value that tracks the velocity of another motion value.

### Hooks
- [useAnimate](mdc:docs/react-use-animate.md): Create an animate function with animation controls, timelines, scoped selectors and automatic cleanup.
- [useAnimationFrame](mdc:docs/react-use-animation-frame.md): Create an animation loop that runs a callback every frame.
- [useDragControls](mdc:docs/react-use-drag-controls.md): Learn how to manually start/stop dragging a motion component with the useDragControls hook.
- [useInView](mdc:docs/react-use-in-view.md): A simple state hook for detecting when an element is within the viewport.
- [useReducedMotion](mdc:docs/react-use-reduced-motion.md): A hook that determines whether the user prefers reduced motion.

### Integrations
- [Framer](mdc:docs/framer.md): Motion for React is already installed in your Framer project. Learn how to use it in your code components and overrides with this simple guide.
- [Integrate Motion with Radix](mdc:docs/radix.md): Learn how to animate Radix components with Motion for React. Easily add layout, exit and spring animations to your Radix components. With live code examples for Tabs, Tooltip and more.

### Guides
- [Accessibility](mdc:docs/react-accessibility.md): How to design accessible animations with Motion for React.
- [Reduce bundle size](mdc:docs/react-reduce-bundle-size.md): Learn what makes up Motion's bundle size, and how to reduce it.
- [Upgrade guide](mdc:docs/react-upgrade-guide.md): How to upgrade to the latest version of Motion for React.

### 3D
- [Layout cameras](mdc:docs/react-three-fiber-layout-cameras.md): A perspective and orthographic camera that integrates with Framer Motion's layout animations.
- [Motion for React Three Fiber](mdc:docs/react-three-fiber.md): Learn how to use Motion for React with React Three Fiber.
- [MotionCanvas](mdc:docs/react-three-fiber-motion-canvas.md): A React Three Fiber Canvas replacement for linking Motion for React DOM and Three.js.


## JavaScript

### Get started
- [Get started with Motion](mdc:docs/quick-start.md): Learn how to install Motion and create your first animation. Motion can animate anything and is the only animation library capable of hardware accelerated animations.

### Animations
- [animate](mdc:docs/animate.md): Learn how to use Motion's animate() function. Animate an element to a target using hardware accelerated animations.
- [Easing functions](mdc:docs/easing-functions.md): Easing functions change the speed of an animation throughout the course of its duration. Learn which ones are included with Motion and how to use them.
- [scroll](mdc:docs/scroll.md): Learn how to create parallax and scroll-linked animations with Motion's scroll() function. It's backwards-compatible with all browsers but also uses ScrollTimeline where possible for hardware accelerated animations.

### Gestures
- [hover](mdc:docs/hover.md): Learn how to create true hover gestures with Motion's hover function. It filters out touch events to fix "stuck" UIs and other broken behaviour.
- [inView](mdc:docs/inview.md): Detect when an element enters or leaves the viewport using Motion's browser-native inView() function.
- [press](mdc:docs/press.md): Learn how to create press gestures with Motion's press() function. Its simple API lets you respond to press start, end and cancel gestures, automatically filtering secondary mouse/touch events and adding keyboard accessibility by default.

### Motion Values
- [motionValue](mdc:docs/motion-value.md): Learn how to use Motion Values, a performant way to track the state and velocity of animated values.

### Integrations
- [CSS](mdc:docs/css.md): Learn how to make spring animations purely in CSS with Motion's spring function.
- [Integrate Motion with Webflow](mdc:docs/webflow.md): Learn how to install Motion in your Webflow project for amazing animation performance and improved SEO.

### Guides

- [Feature comparison](mdc:docs/feature-comparison.md): Compare the bundle size and feature set of Motion and GSAP.
- [Improvements to Web Animations API](mdc:docs/improvements-to-the-web-animations-api-dx.md): Motion adds a number of features that improve the developer experience of the Web Animations API, and patches up some cross-browser inconsistencies.
- [Migrate from GSAP to Motion](mdc:docs/migrate-from-gsap-to-motion.md): Learn how to improve performance and SEO by migrating your animations from GSAP to Motion.
- [Performance](mdc:docs/performance.md): What makes an animation perform well? Perform poorly? Get the most performance from your web animations with Motion.
