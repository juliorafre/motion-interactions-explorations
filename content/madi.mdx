We have developed a highly advanced process enabling our AI to learn and predict various custom properties simultaneously.

## Performance

Several algorithms have been developed to uncover the underlying constraints of the evolutionary process, which can be used to infer the tolerability and favorability of mutations. However, these methods lack accuracy, time responses and high investments in protein engineering campaigns as they don’t account for the fitness data of tested variants during directed evolution. Recent research has revealed signals in evolutionary information such as Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) for homologous and analogous proteins.

This motivates the integration of evolutionary information from protein sequences to guide supervised models that predict intrinsic protein features and fitness of protein variants under specific conditions, thus enhancing the efficacy of protein engineering campaigns and more real-time learnings to users.
