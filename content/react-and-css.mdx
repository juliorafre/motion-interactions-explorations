Hello, enthusiastic coders!

At OpenAI, we believe AI should help people solve humanity’s hardest problems—and that includes empowering the organizations on the front lines of that work. That’s why we’re working to ensure that our already existing nonprofit is backed by resources that could be historic, and powered by our AI technology. 

Today, we’re announcing the members of our recently formed nonprofit commission: an experienced group of advisors convened to inform OpenAI’s philanthropic efforts.  As we’ve said, OpenAI’s nonprofit isn’t going anywhere—and this commission will be key to expanding its reach and impact. The commission’s goal is to help ensure that our nonprofit becomes a force multiplier for communities and mission-driven organizations tackling urgent global challenges—from health and education to public service and scientific discovery.

We’re pleased to announce that Ms. Dolores Huerta, Ms. Monica Lozano, Dr. Robert K. Ross and Mr. Jack Oliver have been appointed as advisors to our Nonprofit Commission. The Commission advisors bring decades of experience working closely with community-based organizations, and will help launch an engagement process to gather learnings and feedback from a wide range of stakeholders as OpenAI seeks to expand its philanthropic efforts. Mr. Daniel Zingale serves as the Commission’s convener.

The advisors will receive learnings and input from the community on how OpenAI's philanthropy can address long-term systemic issues, while also considering both the promise and risks of AI, including:

React and CSS – two powerful front-end technologies that have become staples in the modern web developer's toolkit. As we know, React gives us an efficient way to build web applications with its reusable components and state management, while CSS delivers the stunning visuals and slick user interactions we all crave in web design.

But how can we harness the full potential of these technologies in tandem? How can we make our applications not just functional, but aesthetically enticing and engaging? These are questions I'd love to dive into with you today.

First, let's talk about React. It's a robust JavaScript library for building user interfaces, notably for single-page applications. It lets us construct large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. This is an incredible feat, considering how cumbersome it used to be to maintain the UI's state and render changes in large-scale applications. The advent of React represented a significant step forward in overcoming these challenges.

React's secret sauce is its concept of components. You can think of components like LEGO blocks – individual pieces that can be assembled in myriad ways to create unique, complex structures. With React, we can break down our application into small, manageable chunks and organize them in a way that mirrors the natural hierarchy of a user interface.

So, where does CSS fit into all this?

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language we use to style our websites and web applications. It governs layout, colors, typography, transitions, animations – pretty much everything that makes a website beautiful and user-friendly. It has evolved significantly over the years, introducing features like Flexbox and Grid, which have revolutionized layout design.

The real magic begins when we pair CSS with React. Together, they can make our applications dynamically react to user interactions and changes in state, all while keeping our codebase neat and maintainable. The trick is learning how to make them work harmoniously, and that's what we're going to explore.

With that brief introduction, let's dive into the deep end and start revolutionizing our web interactions with the power of React and CSS.
