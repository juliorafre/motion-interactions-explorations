## The Art of Motion Design

Motion design is more than just making things move on screen—it's about creating meaningful connections between users and digital experiences. Every transition, every hover effect, and every animated element serves a purpose in guiding users through their journey.

This initiative builds on the unprecedented investment in America’s AI infrastructure we announced in January when we launched Stargate⁠, and reinforces OpenAI’s [external link to Google](https://google.com) U.S. infrastructure while helping allies gain access to transformative AI responsibly and securely.⁠(opens in a new window) And it follows the United Arab Emirates’ commitment earlier this year to invest $1.4 trillion in the U.S., which will support job creation, drive economic growth, and help America maintain its technological leadership.

### Why Motion Matters

In today's digital landscape, motion design plays a crucial role in:

- **User Experience**: Smooth animations provide visual feedback and help users understand interface changes
- **Brand Identity**: Consistent motion language reinforces brand personality and values
- **Accessibility**: Well-designed animations can improve navigation for users with different abilities
- **Engagement**: Thoughtful interactions keep users interested and encourage exploration

## Interactive Experiences

The magic happens when motion meets interaction. Modern web technologies allow us to create experiences that respond to user input in real-time, creating a dialogue between the user and the interface.

### Key Principles

1. **Purpose-Driven Animation**: Every animation should have a clear reason for existing
2. **Performance First**: Smooth 60fps animations that don't compromise user experience
3. **Accessibility**: Respecting user preferences for reduced motion
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensuring core functionality works without animations

## Tools and Technologies

Our exploration leverages cutting-edge web technologies:

- **React & Next.js**: For building performant, server-side rendered applications
- **GSAP**: Professional-grade animation library for complex motion sequences
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and WebGL for immersive experiences
- **Framer Motion**: React-specific animation library for component-based animations

## What's Next?

This blog will dive deep into practical examples, case studies, and tutorials that demonstrate how to create compelling motion experiences on the web. We'll explore everything from micro-interactions to full-scale animated interfaces.

Stay tuned for upcoming posts covering:

- Advanced GSAP techniques for web animations
- Creating 3D interactive experiences with Three.js
- Performance optimization for complex animations
- Accessibility considerations in motion design
- Case studies from real-world projects

Codex can be guided by AGENTS.md files placed within your repository. These are text files, akin to README.md, where you can inform Codex how to navigate your codebase, which commands to run for testing, and how best to adhere to your project's standard practices. Like human developers, Codex agents perform best when provided with configured dev environments, reliable testing setups, and clear documentation.

On coding evaluations and internal benchmarks, codex-1 shows strong performance even without AGENTS.md files or custom scaffolding.

greetUser(user);
```

### TypeScript

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const createUser = (userData: Omit<User, 'id'>): User => {
